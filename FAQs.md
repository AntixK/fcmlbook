1. **Why another Machine Learning book?**
As a ML researcher myself, I initially found it very hard to *truly* understand Machine Learning. Yes, there are lots of resources for Machine Learning these days but I found them great to get started; but once you have gotten started, what do you do? The standard reccomendation is to study the following books - "Elements of Statistical Learning" \$$\to$$"Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning"$$\to$$"Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning" so on ending with "Deep Learning" and finally "Started reading and implementing research papers". If it works for you then that's great! But it didn't for me - I usualy lost interest in between as I felt lost most of the time. And I know many students felt this way. This book address precisely that problem - a one-step solution for understanding Machine Learning.

Courses like those offered by fast.ai try to close this gap through practical hands-on approach and learning the theory along the way (which is great!). I found that it is easy to get lost in "what to do next?" once the course is over. So this book attempts to provide a strong theoretical and to some extent, practical framework to study Machine Learning from start to finish.
2. **Why *Farrago* ?**
I wanted to the book title to reflect how I felt learning a lot of ML concepts.
3. **Is the book free?**
The e-Book version is absolutely ***FREE!!***. I am a student and I know what it feels to be one - especially in this field!!
4. **Can I get a hardcopy?**
Thanks for your interest. I am currently in the process of arranging for it and I will post the details soon on this website. Stay tuned!
5. **Can I use it as a textbook?**
Yes, ofcourse. Althought I didn't write this book to be used as such as it does not have the qualities of a text book like problems or worked out examples etc. It can be used as a companion book to your course to help grasp the concepts better.
6. **How can I contact you?**
You can contact me through email - `anandkrish894@gmail.com` or other social venues linked on the side (or on the top if you are reading this on your mobile).
